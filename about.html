           <p>El Maestro is a wise man. A man who can tell what will happen in your life from just looking at you. His specialty though, is reading the tarot cards. What you cant see from the image of El Maestro is that he is a very mysterious man, he is very serious when he needs to be. At other times he is full wit and comedy. He will make you smile and laugh but he will also make you think about the meaning of life. <br><br>
           El maestro has been reading tarot cards for years! Before you were even born. He has developed a sense of awareness that only gods have. If you are interested in him reading your futre, your present , and /or answer any questions you could possibly have then send him a message because he already has answers for you.
           <br> <br>If you've already had a consultation with him please leave a great review on yelp. We all know you loved it!</p>
